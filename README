SUMMARY

    AlbumReminder is an automatic email reminder program, that reads a list of
bands and release dates from a file in your /home. It's currently intended to
be used as a cron job.

REQUIREMENTS

    You must have an SMTP server running on localhost. I used Postfix 2.8.0. If
you want reminders for albums without full dates (mm/dd/yyyy), you'll also have
to make sure AlbumReminder runs on the 1st of the month (I'll fix that soon).

USAGE
